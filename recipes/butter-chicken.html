        <p>
            Butter chicken is a popular Indian dish 
            that originated in the 1950s. It is a creamy 
            and mildly spicy curry that is made with boneless 
            chicken pieces, cooked in a tomato-based gravy, and 
            finished with cream and butter. The dish has a rich 
            and velvety texture, and its complex blend of flavors 
            makes it a crowd-pleaser.
